## Perform a Chi-squared test

The Library of Montana State University has a website that students use to find books and articles. Below the library picture, there is a search bar and three big items: “Find”, “Request” and “Interact”. All three of them contain access to important information and services that the library prides itself in offering. However, the Website Analytics show that the “Interact” button has, ironically, almost no interactions. 

The website team settled on 4 different new versions to test against the original “Interact” button: Connect, Learn, Help and Services. It was decided that for a version to be considered superior, a minimum increase in click-through rate of 30% had to be detected and the desired Statistical Significance was chosen to be 90%.

The hypotheses to be tested in the experiment are the following:  
     
- **Null Hypothesis**: all versions have the same CTR.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: there is a difference in the CTR for the different versions.  

Our task was to use the collected data from May 29, 2013, to June 18, 2013 to perform a Chi-squared test with Python.
